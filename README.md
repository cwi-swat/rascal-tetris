The Tetris demo was written by Atze van der Ploeg.

It demonstrates the Rascal language and in particular the library for interactive software visualization (Figure).

Rascal is a language for meta-programming, not particularly apt for implementing games. 

However, this demo pushes the boundaries of the interactive visualization capabilities of the Figure library (which is in the Rascal standard library)
and it works very nicely.

```
rascal>import tetris::Tetris;
ok
rascal>playTetris();
ok
```
